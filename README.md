# Learning Coding Concepts
## Setting up the project environment 
1. Setup the virtual environment if this is your first time. Ignore if you have a .venv in your root already.
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment.
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. Download the dependancies if this is your first time.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. To install dependancies, do the following. 
```
pip install <DEPENDANCY_NAME>
```
5. To update the requirements file at root.
```
pip freeze >> requirements.txt
```
6. Exit the virtual environment.
```
deactivate 
```
